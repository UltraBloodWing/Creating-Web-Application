				<h3 class="sub-sub-heading">Resume</h3>
					<p>
						I am a student at <strong>Swinburne University of Technology</strong>&#44; Sarawak Campus. studying <strong>Bechelors of Computer Science</strong>.
						After highschool, I joined a local college and gained a <em>Diploma in IT</em>. Since then I've been working in the fields of
						<em>IT&#47; Accounting</em> (In small companies you have to do it all). Most of my experience from IT side involves networking&#44; 
						troubleshooting &amp; a bit of server management.
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, I got the chance to be involved in the process of ERP software change from Oracle ERP to Ms. Dynamics Nav
						in my last work place <strong>Housing Development Corporation Ltd</strong>.
						I worked along side with the team allocated to work with the developers on behalf of company for blackbox testings
						of Procurement&#44; Inventory&#44; Finance &amp; HR related modules for the implementation process.
					</p>
					<p>
						My interest to learn programming comes mainly from my love of maths and the fact that it involves alot of critical thinking 
						and problem solving; in-addition, having worked with several software&#47;developers in numerous occasions help me decide 
						where I&apos;ll go next. Henceforth, right before I planned to join Swinburne, for a kickstart I learned basics of OOP concepts 
						using JAVA with the help of my colleagues and from the tremendous contents available online.
					</p>
					<p>
						I believe the experience in business related fields is an added advange to start a career as a software engineer.

				<p>
					I come from <strong>Republic of Maldives</strong>&#44; which is a small island nation of more than 2000 islands spread across 
					in midst of the Indian Ocean. It has a population of approximately half a million people and their main economic activities 
					are Tourism and Fishing. It is mostly famous for it&apos;s white sandy beaches and crystal clear waters. They have their own language
					&amp; alphabet&#44; namely "Divehi &amp; Thaana" respectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most locals live a very simple life. Main activities of enjoyment are sport fishing&#44; BBQ&#44; snorkeling&#44; diving and mostly anything
					to do with sea or just hanging around in at the beach at sunset. It all makes sennse because in any given location in 
					Maldives&#44; you'll reach water within 15min walk maximum. Only a few islands are even that big. 
					Over 90% of the islands you can walk to beach within 5 mins. And over 97% of the country's vast geogrophical area is covered 
					by ocean.
				</p>
				<p>
				Things I like to do in my freetimes are&#58;
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Photography</li>
						<li>Scuba diving&#44; freeddiving</li>
						<li>freeddiving &amp; spearfishing</li>
						<li>Drawing (Pencil Art)</li>
						<li>Deep conversations</li>
						<li>Learning via articles and youtube to fill my curiousity</li>
